    int i=0;//the i value here is for the array as the index of array starts from 0 .
    int Matrix[]=new int[100];//the 100 inside the int is the size of the array starting from 0 to 99.
    
    while(input!=0)//here in this case we want something to run the while case so we are taking input not equal to zero.even if we give input as 0 we get accurate answer only.
                    //as below loop doesnt work, the next step is the for loop.. here i =0 so j becomes 0 , j is equals to 0 and than it gets printed into matrix[j].
                      //here j is the index..so how does the answer show 0 ?? it is because if we dont declare any value the compiler automatically declares as 0 for int values.//hence we get 0.

    {
      Matrix[i]=input%2;//here first we are declaring the array's first index as 0,and then we are assigning the values in the array which will comply by the
                          //input%2 case..here we are taking the remainder of the int value by 2...
      input = input/2;//now we get the quotient which will give a new input value which again goes up and finds the remainder.
      i++;//the i value gets incremented in each case so that the index value changes .

    }//so basically this loop stops when input value becomes 0. 
    /*here we do get the binary number but in reverse.
    *for example
    we need binary value of 5..
    2|_5__---->let 5 be the input or the int value we give,and 2 is the number which we are doing the operation cuz binary numbers have base 2!
     2 |_2__---->||remainder=1||,we get it because..in the above case we have 5,we need to check which multiple of 2 is closer to 5,4 is closer!so write the quotient down which is 2,now we will have a remainder 1 write it to the side.2*2+1=5.
       2|_1__---->||remainder = 0||
          |______||remainder =1|| 
          our program give the binary value in reverse order ..if you want once print the value of Matrix[i] value now ull get binary value in reverse
          so to avoid that we need to reverse it.

    for(int j = i;j>=0;j--)//here we are equating j value to i,the i value here is the last incremented value from the above while loop,
